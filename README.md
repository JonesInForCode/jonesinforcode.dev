# JonesInForCode.dev

Welcome to my portfolio project! This is my personal website where I showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a full-stack developer. The goal of this project is to create a unique and professional online presence that reflects my passion for modern web development.

## About This Project

This portfolio is a culmination of designs, inspirations, and ideas I’ve gathered from various sources on the web, as well as assistance from AI tools. While I’ve drawn inspiration from existing designs and concepts, I want to emphasize that the final design and implementation will be entirely unique and tailored to my personal style and goals.

I have no intention of violating anyone else’s intellectual property or ideas. Instead, I aim to use what I’ve learned and observed as a foundation to build something original and meaningful. This project is a creative expression of my skills and a way to showcase my growth as a developer.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on devices of all sizes.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Styled Components.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Highlights the active section as you scroll through the page.
- **Showcase of Projects**: A dedicated section to highlight my recent work.
- **Contact Section**: Easy ways to get in touch with me for collaboration or inquiries.

## Why a Single Page Application (SPA)?

This portfolio is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. By using an SPA, the entire site is loaded once, and navigation between sections is handled dynamically without requiring full page reloads. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Faster Navigation**: Since the content is already loaded, navigating between sections is instantaneous.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The scrolling feature allows users to easily navigate through the site, creating a natural and intuitive flow.
- **Mobile and Desktop Friendly**: The scrolling navigation is optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, ensuring a consistent experience across all screen sizes.
- **Improved Performance**: SPAs reduce server load by minimizing the number of requests made to the server, resulting in faster load times.

By combining the SPA architecture with a scrolling navigation feature, this portfolio is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for visitors to explore my work and learn more about me.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Styled Components
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS and Styled Components
- **Version Control**: Git

## Acknowledgments

I’d like to acknowledge the incredible designs and ideas shared by the web development community, which have served as inspiration for this project. Additionally, I’ve utilized AI tools to assist with coding and brainstorming, ensuring that the final product is polished and professional.

## Future Plans
